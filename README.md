In order to work with a database, it is useful to have some background in the domain of data being stored. Here is a very quick tour of beer. If you want to know more, see the Wikipedia Beer Portal.

Beer is a fermented drink based on grain, yeast, hops and water. The grain is typically malted barley, but wide variety of other grains (e.g. oats, rye) can be used. There are a wide variety of beers, differing in the grains used, the yeast strain, and the hops. More highly roasted grains produce darker beers, different types of yeast produce different flavour profiles, and hops provide aroma and bitterness. To add even more variety, adjuncts (e.g. sugar, chocolate, flowers, pine needles, to name but a few) can be added.
